## Payment backend

This project was created as a way to participate in the yearly event
[Rinha de Backend][event] (edition 2025), a community competition to
create a backend in any programming language and with any technologies
to resolve a determined problem.

> [!NOTE]
> Sadly, this project cannot participate of the competition, but it
> will be finished. The main goal is to learn - but win is cool!
